# Blaze Engine
This is a framework made to speed up C++ application development. It implements basic and advanced data structures as well as frequently needed functionalities such as image loading and saving, threading classes, logging system, file manipulation, etc. Everything is written in a consistent manner and in one place.

Blaze Engine is written in C++20 to leverage its latest features, e.g. concepts. It is divided into three libraries: 
- Blaze Engine Core - this library is independant of any other and can be used as a standalone library. It defines and implements the basic types, data structures and classes
- Blaze Engine - all of the more complex classes and systems are implemented in this library. There are other libraries that it depends on.
- Blaze Engine Graphics - wraps a graphics API and implements graphics related classes and systems. One of the systems is the UI system.

**Blaze_Engine is still under development and many things change very fast.**
